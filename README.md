# SQL Query Runner
This web app helps you run and instantly view the results of your queries, there's a mock database that you can view
and then send SQL commands to. You can either make your own query or use one of the predefined
queries. Please have fun using this 😁.

## I used **React** and the following packages: 
1. create-react-app
2. Material UI
3. react-papaparse
  
 ## Page Load Time
  this app has a page load time of 271ms, i used [pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com/#604414dd70400000) to check this
  
 ## Optimisations Made
 1. All external files where fetched after the page loads
 2. i used views instead of pages to prevent page redirects
